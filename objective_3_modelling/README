Objective 3: Estimation of Health (SOH) and Power (SOP)

Goal
Develop Machine Learning models to estimate **State of Health (SOH)** and **State of Power (SOP) for OEM 1 cells. The challenge is to predict these discharge performance metrics using **only charging data**, enabling rapid grading without full discharge tests.

Model Architecture
Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
Input Features: Statistics derived from the **Charge Phase** (Voltage Mean/Std, Current Mean, Charge Time, etc.).
Target Variables:
    SOH (State of Health):** $\frac{\text{Actual Discharge Capacity}}{\text{Rated Capacity (4800 mAh)}}$
    SOP (State of Power):** $\frac{\text{Actual Peak Power}}{\text{Rated Power (26 W)}}$

How to Run
1. Ensure `../data/1.csv` exists.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python estimate_soh_sop.py
