Conclusions: Feature 10 Identification

Findings
dentity: Feature 10 is Energy (mWh).
Statistical Evidence:
    Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($R$): **1.000**
    The relationship is perfectly linear with the product of Voltage and Current over time.

Justification
The values in Feature 10 align perfectly with the cumulative energy throughput of the cell. While `Capacity` tracks the flow of charge (Amps $\times$ Time), `Feature 10` tracks the flow of work (Watts $\times$ Time), which is the definition of electrical energy.
