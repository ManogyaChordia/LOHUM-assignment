objective 1: Feature Identification

Goal
Determine the physical significance of the unlabeled **"Feature 10"** column in the provided dataset.

Methodology
1.  Hypothesis: Based on unit analysis (numerical range similar to Capacity $\times$ Voltage), we hypothesized Feature 10 represents **Energy (mWh)**.
2.  Physics Derivation: Energy is defined as the time integral of Power ($E = \int V \cdot I \, dt$).
3.  Verification: We calculated a proxy for energy ($Capacity_{mAh} \times Voltage_{V}$) and computed the Pearson correlation coefficient against Feature 10.

How to Run
1. Ensure `../data/1.csv` exists.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python identify_feature.py
