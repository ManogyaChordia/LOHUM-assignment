Conclusions: Comparative Analysis

1. OEM 2: High Energy (Best for Storage)
Capacity: Highest average capacity (~4734 mAh).
Consistency: Very consistent manufacturing (low variance).
use Case: Ideal for stationary storage applications where runtime is critical.

2. OEM 3: High Power (Best Health)
Resistance: Lowest Internal Resistance (~0.18 $\Omega$).
Efficiency: Generates the least heat during operation.
Use Case: Ideal for high-power applications (e.g., power tools, acceleration) or where cooling is limited.

3. OEM 1: Lower Tier (Degraded)
Performance: Moderate capacity but significantly higher and more variable internal resistance (~0.68 $\Omega$).
Implication: Signs of inconsistent aging or lower manufacturing quality.
Use Case: Suitable for low-stress applications (e.g., solar street lights).
